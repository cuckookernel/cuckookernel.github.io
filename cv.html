(##) Summary

Applied mathematician and quantitative developer with 7 years of experience in
the development of machine learning and predictive models for commercial
banking and proptech, and 4 years of experience in the development of HF servers for automated
market making of listed options. I combine specialized mathematical knowledge,
top notch analytic skills, programming proficiency in a variety of languages and
experience with big data tools from the Hadoop Ecosystem. I hold a PhD in Applied
Mathematics from Cornell University with an emphasis in probability and
simulation.
